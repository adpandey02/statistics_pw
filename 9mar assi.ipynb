    "Q1: Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are both mathematical tools used to describe\n",
    "the probabilities of a random variable taking certain values.\n",
    "A PMF is used for discrete random variables and gives the probability of each possible value that the random variable can take.\n",
    "For example, consider rolling a fair six-sided die. The PMF of the outcome of the roll would be:\n",
    "PMF(x) = 1/6, for x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n",
    "This means that the probability of rolling a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 is each 1/6.\n",
    "A PDF is used for continuous random variables and gives the relative likelihood of the variable\n",
    "taking on a particular value. The area under the curve of a PDF equals the probability of the variable falling \n",
    "within a certain range of values. For example, consider the height of people in a certain population. The PDF of their\n",
    "heights might look like a bell-shaped curve, known as the normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: The Cumulative Density Function (CDF) is another mathematical tool used in probability theory. It gives the probability that\n",
    "a random variable takes on a value less than or equal to a specific value.\n",
    "For example, consider a continuous random variable X with PDF f(x). The CDF of X, denoted by F(x), is defined as:\n",
    "F(x) = P(X ≤ x) = ∫f(t)dt from -infinity to x\n",
    "In other words, the CDF at a given point x is equal to the area under the curve of the PDF from negative infinity up to that point.\n",
    "The CDF is used because it provides a way to compute the probability that a continuous random variable takes on a value in a particular\n",
    "interval, by taking the difference between the CDF at the upper and lower bounds of the interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: The normal distribution is commonly used as a model in situations where the variable being measured is a continuous quantity\n",
    "that is the sum of many small, independent, and identically distributed random variables. The normal distribution is also used as \n",
    "an approximation for many other types of distributions in statistics.\n",
    "For example, the heights of a large group of people, the weights of products produced by a manufacturing process,\n",
    "and the daily returns of a stock market are all often modeled with a normal distribution.\n",
    "The normal distribution is characterized by two parameters: the mean  and the standard deviation. \n",
    "The mean determines the location of the center of the distribution, while the standard deviation determines the spread or width of thedistribution\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4: The normal distribution is important because it is used as a model for many natural and social phenomena in science,\n",
    "engineering, and business. Its importance stems from its mathematical properties, which make it easier to analyze and interpret data.\n",
    "Real-life examples of normal distribution include:\n",
    "Heights of people in a population\n",
    "Weights of products produced by a manufacturing process\n",
    "IQ scores of a large group of people\n",
    "Daily returns of a stock market\n",
    "Errors in measurements made by instruments\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5: The Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution that describes the outcomes of a single \n",
    "binary experiment, where the result is either success (1) or failure (0). It is characterized by a single parameter p, \n",
    "which is the probability of success. The probability mass function (PMF) of the Bernoulli distribution is:\n",
    "P(X = k) = p^k * (1-p)^(1-k) for k = 0 or 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6: First, we need to standardize the value 60 using the z-score formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "z = (x - μ) / σ\n",
    "\n",
    "where x is the value we want to standardize (in this case, x = 60), μ is the mean of the distribution (μ = 50), and σ is the\n",
    "standard deviation of the distribution (σ = 10).\n",
    "\n",
    "z = (60 - 50) / 10 = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we can use a standard normal distribution table or calculator to find the probability that a z-score is smaller than 1.\n",
    "This probability is approximately 0.84.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected observation from the given dataset will be \n",
    "greater than 60 is 1 - 0.84 = 0.16 or about 16%.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7: The uniform distribution is a continuous probability distribution that describes a situation where all values in\n",
    "a given interval are equally likely. The probability density function (PDF) of a uniform distribution is:\n",
    "f(x) = 1/(b-a) for a ≤ x ≤ b\n",
    "where a and b are the lower and upper bounds of the interval. For example, consider rolling a fair six-sided die.\n",
    "The outcome of the roll is a discrete uniform distribution over the integers 1 through 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8: The z-score, also known as the standard score, is a measure of how many standard deviations a data point is away from \n",
    "the mean of a normal distribution. It is calculated as:\n",
    "z = (x - μ) / σ\n",
    "where x is the data point, μ is the mean of the distribution, and σ is the standard deviation of the distribution.\n",
    "The z-score is important because it allows us to compare values from different normal distributions on a common scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9: The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental theorem in statistics that states that the sum or average of a \n",
    "large number of independent and identically distributed random variables will be approximately normally distributed,\n",
    "regardless of the distribution of the original variables.\n",
    "The significance of the CLT is that it allows us to make probabilistic statements about the mean or sum of a large sample, \n",
    "even if we do not know the underlying distribution of the population. This is particularly important in hypothesis testing,\n",
    "where we need to estimate the mean or sum of a population based on a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10: The assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem are:\n",
    "The sample size is large enough, typically n ≥ 30.\n",
    "The sample is drawn from a population with a finite mean and variance.\n",
    "The sample observations are independent of each other."
